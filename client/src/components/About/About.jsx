      <p>Im a Full Stack Developer who likes to make things simpler. That's my work methodology!</p>
      <p>
        I started coding in 2021, with some courses from UBA, followed by others from the city government.
        Then, I went to "Argentina Programa", where I learnt JavaScript for the first time, together with another languages.
        Until I discovered Henry! And although at first I found myself unable to adapt to program times, I managed to reach the instance of the individual project!
      </p>
      <p>My skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React-Redux, Express, PostgreSQL and Sequelize.</p>
